# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard is perfect for any one concerned with the weather in any city. The dashboard shows the current weather as well as predicted weather for the next five days, making it a great tool to help plan for trips, events, and more.

## Usage

When you first use the application, simply type in your desired city and click the submit button. The UI will dynamically update to display the current weather and a five day forecast. The first and biggest box will display the current weather, and the forecast will be shown in the five smaller boxes below.
